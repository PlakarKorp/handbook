# Plakar Governance

## Overview

This document outlines the governance structure for the Plakar project, which operates under a dual-purpose model: supporting an open-source community while also adhering to the objectives of Plakar as a corporate entity. It defines how decisions are made, the roles and responsibilities within the community and the company, and the processes for managing contributions and direction. The goal is to balance the openness and collaboration of an open-source project with the strategic goals of the corporate entity.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### 1. Corporate Maintainers
Corporate maintainers are employees of Plakar who are responsible for the strategic alignment of the open-source project with the company’s goals. They ensure that the project remains sustainable, compliant with internal policies, and continues to serve its user base effectively.

**Corporate Maintainer Responsibilities:**
- Reviewing and approving contributions that have potential business impact.
- Ensuring the project's roadmap aligns with corporate strategy.
- Managing project releases and overseeing security policies.
- Providing support and resources for project maintenance and development.

**Current Corporate Maintainers:**
- [Name or Username] - [email@example.com]
- [Name or Username] - [email@example.com]

### 2. Open-Source Project Maintainers
Open-source maintainers are responsible for the overall health and technical direction of the project. They have commit access to the repository and lead technical discussions, reviews, and project planning.

**Open-Source Maintainer Responsibilities:**
- Reviewing and merging pull requests.
- Managing releases and ensuring code quality.
- Facilitating discussions around new features, changes, and project direction.
- Upholding the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

**Current Open-Source Maintainers:**
- [Name or Username] - [email@example.com]
- [Name or Username] - [email@example.com]

### 3. Core Contributors
Core contributors are active members of the community who have made significant and sustained contributions to the project. They may have specialized knowledge in certain areas and assist maintainers in code reviews, issue triaging, and mentoring new contributors.

**Core Contributor Responsibilities:**
- Reviewing code submissions and providing constructive feedback.
- Assisting in issue triaging and supporting community discussions.
- Advocating for new features or enhancements that align with project goals.

### 4. Community Contributors
Community contributors include anyone who submits a pull request, reports an issue, or participates in discussions. Their contributions help improve the project by sharing their time, expertise, and feedback.

**Community Contributor Responsibilities:**
- Submitting pull requests that follow the project's [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.
- Participating in issue discussions and offering suggestions or patches.
- Respecting the decisions and guidance of maintainers and core contributors.

### 5. Corporate Stakeholders
Corporate stakeholders include employees or departments within Plakar that have an interest in the direction of the project. They may contribute to decision-making for business-related features, security policies, or compliance needs.

**Corporate Stakeholder Responsibilities:**
- Providing input on features or changes that impact corporate use cases or strategy.
- Ensuring compliance with internal policies and external regulations.
- Allocating resources for the continued development and maintenance of the project.

### 6. Users
Users provide valuable feedback, report bugs, and contribute to discussions. Although they may not contribute code directly, their feedback and insights are crucial for the project's development.

**User Responsibilities:**
- Reporting bugs and providing feedback in a clear and constructive manner.
- Participating in discussions to improve the user experience.

## Decision-Making Process

The Plakar project follows a combined model for decision-making, focusing on technical merit, community consensus, and corporate alignment. The decision-making process varies depending on the type and impact of the decision.

### Consensus-Based Decision Making
For most open-source decisions, maintainers and core contributors strive to reach consensus through discussion. This process involves:

1. Open discussions in GitHub issues, pull requests, or community channels.
2. Soliciting input from the community and affected parties.
3. Making decisions based on community feedback and technical merit.

### Corporate Alignment Decision Making
For decisions that have business implications, such as product strategy, licensing, or partnerships, the corporate maintainers have final authority. They will consider community input but will make decisions based on what aligns best with Plakar’s corporate strategy.

### Voting
In cases where consensus cannot be reached on non-strategic matters, a vote may be called among maintainers and core contributors. A majority vote will determine the outcome.

## Conflict Resolution

In the event of a conflict or disagreement between community members, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Step 1: Direct Communication**  
   - Individuals involved in the conflict should first attempt to resolve it through direct, respectful communication.

2. **Step 2: Mediation by a Maintainer**  
   - If the conflict cannot be resolved directly, a neutral maintainer will act as a mediator to facilitate a resolution.

3. **Step 3: Final Decision by Corporate Maintainers**  
   - If the conflict remains unresolved or has business implications, corporate maintainers will make the final decision based on the best interests of both the open-source community and the company.

## Adding and Removing Maintainers and Core Contributors

### Adding New Maintainers
- A new maintainer can be proposed by any existing maintainer or corporate stakeholder.
- The decision to add a new maintainer is made through a consensus vote among corporate and open-source maintainers.
- Candidates should have a track record of consistent and high-quality contributions, as well as active participation in community discussions.

### Removing Maintainers
A maintainer may be removed in the following circumstances:
- Persistent inactivity for a significant period of time.
- Repeated violations of the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Failure to uphold the responsibilities of the role.
- Changes in employment status for corporate maintainers.

### Adding and Removing Core Contributors
- Core contributors can be nominated by any maintainer or core contributor.
- The nomination should be based on consistent and meaningful contributions to the project.
- Removal follows the same criteria as for maintainers.

## Governance Changes

Changes to this governance structure can be proposed by any corporate stakeholder, maintainer, or core contributor. Such changes require consensus among the corporate maintainers or a majority vote if consensus cannot be reached.
